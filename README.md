# CAR RENTAL PLATFORM

Authors: @juuroudojo, @comprido96

This project demonstrates a basic example of DApp concerning car rentals.
The logic is based around the Rent contract which acts as a platform in which users can add their cars and list them on offers. Moreover, renters can 
sign for an offer or place a counteroffer in order to get a deal on their terms. 
It's responsibility of the car owner to approve any counteroffer and finalise the deal; after that, the rent starts.

The project comes with a contracts folder (Solidity) and a test script (TypeScript), within the Hardhat framework. 
Moreoever, we developed a mockup user interface with React which is still in Beta phase.
